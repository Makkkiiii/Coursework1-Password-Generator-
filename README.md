# Password-Generator
This is my first self-project (using reference) in which I made a password Generator.

For this project, we created a password generator using only the **C** language. It bears similarities to other password generators available online. It is equivalent to **Generating a specific number of passwords with upper and lower case, special characters, and numbers**. Additionally, this program creates a file for you in which the _Generated Passwords_ are kept. 

As an illustration,

Suppose you created the password "agUTxImA61aXmep". You will be prompted by the program to name a "File" before it can be created.
The password will be saved in the **File** once it has been generated. That is if the **File** was named "PASSWORD". That file will be created by the program and placed in the folder containing it.  

Therefore, **PASSWORD** will contain the generated password "agUTxImA61aXmep". 

**FOR WINDOWS**

Utilize any software you typically use to code, such as **CodeBlocks**, **Visual Studio Code**, **Dev C++**, etc.
Run the code by copying and pasting it into your application.

Assume you created a **File** named "**password_generator.c**."

**FOR LINUX**

Use programs such as **mousepad**, **vim**, **nano**, **Gedit**, etc. to create and save a file called **password_generator.c**.

After that, you need to compile it.
USE **gcc -o password_generator password_generator.c**

You can then launch the program after this.
Run the program with **./password_generator.c**.
