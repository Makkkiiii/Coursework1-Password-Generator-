Password Generator - 26th May (1st Semester)

## About
This is the first project where I created a **Password Generator** using **C**.

It bears similarities to other password generators available online. It can be used for **Generating a specific number of passwords with upper and lower case, special characters, and numbers**. Additionally, this program creates a file for you in which the _Generated Passwords_ are kept.

## Features
- Can be of any length.
- Includes upper and lower characters.
- Includes Special Characters.
- Saves password to a text file.
- N number of passwords can be generated.
- Generated Passwords labeled as "Weak", "Medium", "Strong"
- The user can generate more passwords if he/she does not like the password given before.

# Getting Started
To get started, you can either compile the source code or use the pre-compiled executable file.

## Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler (if compiling from source)

# Working

As an illustration,

Suppose the program created the password "**agUTxImA61aXmep**". You will be prompted by the program to name a "File" before it can be created.
The password will be saved in the **File** once it has been generated. That is if the **File** was named "PASSWORD". That file will be created by the program and placed in the folder where the program is. (Folder you saved your program in).  

Therefore, The file **PASSWORD** will contain the generated password "**agUTxImA61aXmep**". 

# Installations

## 1. FOR WINDOWS

### - Download the zip file.
### - Unzip the zip file.
### - Run it on your machine.

## 2. FOR LINUX

Assume you created a **File** named "**password_generator.c**."

Use programs such as **Mousepad**, **Mim**, **Nano**, **Gedit**, etc. to create and save a file called **password_generator.c**.

After that, you need to compile it.
USE **gcc -o password_generator password_generator.c**

You can then launch the program after this.
Run the program with **./password_generator.c**.

## 3. FOR MAC

_It is similar to Linux._

You can use coding software or on the terminal. It's your choice ðŸ˜Š.

If you are using an IDE then do the same we did for **WINDOWS**. If you are doing it in a terminal aka CLI, follow the steps mentioned below.

Use any text editor to create a file named **password_generator.c**. 

Open Terminal, navigate to the directory containing **password_generator.c**, and compile it using **gcc -o password_generator password_generator.c**.

Execute the compiled program with **./password_generator**.
