# Password-Generator
This is my first self-project (using reference) in which I made a password Generator.

In this project we used only **C** Language to create a password Generator. It is similar to the other Password Generators that you can find on the internet. It does the same things as **Generating a particular length of passwords** that includes **Upper and Lower case letters, special characters, and numbers**. This program also makes you a file in which the _Generated Passwords_ is stored in the particular file. 

For example,
Let's say you generated a password "agUTxImA61aXmep". The program will prompt you to name a "File" so that it can create it.
After the **File** is created the password will be stored in it. So if you named the **File** "PASSWORD". The program will create that file in the folder your program is in. 

So, The generated password "agUTxImA61aXmep" will stored in **PASSWORD**. 

**FOR WINDOWS**
Use any programs in which you usually code (**Dev C++**, **Visual Studio Code**, **CodeBlocks**, etc)
Copy and paste the code into your application and run the code.

**FOR LINUX**
Make a file named **<<filename>>.c** using the **mousepad**, **vim**, **nano**, **Gedit**, etc, and save it.

After that, you need to compile it.
USE **gcc -o <<filename>> <<filename>>.c**

After this, you can run the program.
Use **./<<filename>>.c** to run the program.
