Password Generator - 26th May (1st Semester)

## About
This is the first project where I created a **Password Generator** using **C**.

It bears similarities to other password generators available online. It can be used for **Generating a specific number of passwords with upper and lower case, special characters, and numbers**. Additionally, this program creates a file for you in which the _Generated Passwords_ are kept.

## Features
- Can be of any length.
- Includes upper and lower characters.
- Includes Special Characters.
- Saves password to a text file.
- N number of passwords can be generated.
- Generated Passwords labeled as "Weak", "Medium", "Strong"
- The user can generate more passwords if he/she does not like the password given before.

## Getting Started
To get started, you can either compile the source code or use the pre-compiled executable file.

## Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler (if compiling from source)

## Working

As an illustration,

Suppose the program created the password "**agUTxImA61aXmep**". You will be prompted by the program to name a **File** to create it.
The password will be saved in the **File** once it has been generated. If your file name is **Password**, The file **PASSWORD** will contain the generated password.
